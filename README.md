This project represents my Master’s degree research, documented in the attached thesis PDF with supporting screenshots of the system and code.
The study explores the use of machine learning algorithms enhanced by a bio-inspired optimization method (Fire Hawk Optimizer) to identify fake profiles on social networking platforms, demonstrating improved detection performance and robustness.
